WYSIWIM and responsive editing
------------------------------

Working on digital content gives us the possibility to edit it in ways
that are different from how it will be displayed to the public. We
should leverage this freedom.

WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) is for manifacturing the real
world, but in the digital world it leads to complex and artificial
interfaces that are normally very complex to build and to use, often
leaving us with lack of control and a frustrated editors that cannot
realize what they have in mind.

Our approach to content editing is WYSIWIM (what you see is what you
mean): an editor should be provided with an interface that gives her a
better control at her level of understanding of what she's working on.
For example on a website we always display HTML but editing on a text
could be performed in Markdown or other simplified markup formats for
most of the cases.

WYSIWIM, coupled with a real-time preview (... and possibly enough space
on your screen) can lead to better control in content editing and makes
easier to build and maintain editing interfaces for different kind of
content.

WYSIWIM does not mean "raw" editing, it focus on using the right tool
for tuning a precise aspect of your content, based on what you want to
touch and possibily on who you are. This introduces the concept of
**responsive editing**: providing the right editing interface for the
right situation.
